# Hands On: Version Control System and Why It Is Needed

A **Version Control System** (VCS) is a vital tool in software development, designed to track and manage changes to code or documents over time. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same project effectively.

## Real-Life Scenario

If a member "_Tom_" makes changes to the home page file "_index.html_" to update the navigation and at the same time, another team member "_Jerry_" makes changes to add contact information to the footer of the same home page thereby editing the same index.html file.
